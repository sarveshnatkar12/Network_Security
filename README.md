# Network Security: Phishing URL Detection using Machine Learning  
[Deployed App](https://phishingapp.duckdns.org/)

---

## Project Overview

Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information by disguising malicious websites as trustworthy ones. This project uses Machine Learning to detect phishing URLs based on 30+ extracted features. The goal is to classify URLs as **Legitimate** or **Phishing** using a trained ML model.

Users can:
- Upload a CSV of URLs for bulk predictions.
- Trigger model training directly from the web UI.
- Deploy the pipeline via CI/CD to AWS EC2 with Docker + GitHub Actions.

## Features

- **MongoDB-based data ingestion**
- **Validation**: Schema checks + Data drift detection
- **Transformation**: Missing value imputation with KNN
- **Modeling**: Random Forest (F1 ≈ 0.97), GridSearchCV + CalibratedClassifierCV
- **Evaluation**: Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- **MLflow + DagsHub tracking**
- **FastAPI backend** with `/train` and `/predict`
- **Dockerized**, deployed to **EC2** via **GitHub Actions**
- **Free custom domain** via [DuckDNS](https://duckdns.org)

##How It Works

###Pipeline Steps:
1. **Ingestion**: Pull data from MongoDB Atlas → Store locally → Split train/test
2. **Validation**: Schema check + Drift detection (KS-Test)
3. **Transformation**: KNNImputer for missing values → Save `.npy` and preprocessor
4. **Model Training**: Train/tune models → Pick best → Save + Log to MLflow/DagsHub
5. **Sync to S3**: Artifacts + final model are pushed to an S3 bucket
6. **Serve with FastAPI**: `/train` and `/predict` endpoints
7. **Deploy with GitHub Actions**: Builds + pushes Docker image → Pulls & runs on EC2

##Web App Endpoints

| Endpoint      | Method | Description                     |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| `/`           | GET    | Homepage with UI buttons        |
| `/train`      | GET    | Triggers full ML pipeline       |
| `/predict`    | POST   | Accepts CSV of URLs and predicts |
| `/ping`       | GET    | Health check (optional)         |

##Deployment

###Local Docker Build & Run
```bash
docker build -t phishingapp-local .
docker run -d -p 8120:8120 --name phishingapp-local phishingapp-local:latest

Cloud Deployment (CI/CD)
Create AWS EC2 instance + ECR + S3

Configure GitHub Secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

AWS_REGION

ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME

AWS_ECR_REPOSITORY_URL

Push code to GitHub and manually trigger the workflow.

App will be auto-deployed to EC2.

Free Domain (HTTPS Optional)
Using DuckDNS:

Chose: phishingapp.duckdns.org (linked to EC2 public IP)

Configured via NGINX for proxy to port 8120

Example Prediction Flow
Go to phishingapp.duckdns.org

Upload phisingData.csv

Click Predict

Get results in styled table with output saved

Sample Input Features
30 features like:

having_IP_Address, URL_Length, Shortining_Service

SSLfinal_State, Domain_registeration_length

Google_Index, Links_pointing_to_page

and more...

Target: Result (1 = Phishing, -1 = Legitimate)
